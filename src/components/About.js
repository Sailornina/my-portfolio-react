            I'm a self-taught Software Developer. I considerer myself as a curious person and passionate about technology, thatâ€™s why I also decided to start studying Web Programming through Full Stack Open and The Odin Project but also this year I will start studying a bootcamp called Technigo. I'm continuously improving my skills and I'm eager to keep learning and contribute in a collaborative team/environment. <br /><br />
            I am argentine living in Sweden three years ago. So I'm still studying Swedish and enjoying fika. As for me, I like to watch anime, play Phasmophofia with friends as well as enjoy a day of hiking. I created this website to showcase some of the work I've done so far! Please take a look at my page and have fun! I hope to hear from you soon.<br /><br />
